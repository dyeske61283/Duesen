# Create a Blog Using Your Own Database Schema

**Project premise**

A blog system from scratch is a fantastic way to upgrade your CRUD skills, along with your ability to create database architectures. In this project, you’ll be required to create your own APIs in order to connect with the database and the front end to display your data.
Focus on the functionality of the blog rather than the look of it. I recommended that you use a bootstrap of sorts, like Twitter Bootstrap or CSS Materialize, to speed up your development process.
For your database, you can use either a mySQL database, or a table-less like MongoDB. Most employers are still using mySQL due to legacy reasons, while startups tend to lean more towards table-less architectures. Whatever your choice, they are equally valid in terms of usefulness on your resume.
The focus of this project is the database, the interfaces connecting to the database, and the rendering of data. API creation will let you traverse into the realm of Node.js, or whatever back end technology you’ve chosen.
While a blog may sound simple, it is a proper full stack project that can be transferred into a live environment.

**Business rules requirements**
- User must log in before making a post
- User can create, update and delete posts
- User can attach categories and tags to posts
- Anyone can view posts

**Expected skills upgrade/obtained**
- Database architecture
- API creation using a back end technology
- Increase in technical depth for chosen front end framework or library

## Planned Tech-Stack

- Backend: ASP.NET Core (V 3.1)
- Frontend: Vue with Vuetify
- Database: ??? mySQL/Maria

## Disclaimer

This is (as of now at least) a purely personal project. Let's see where this is going. :)
